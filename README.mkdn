# NAME

Perl::Critic::Policy::Variables::ProhibitLoopOnHash - Don't write loops on hashes, only on keys and values of hashes

# VERSION

version 0.006

# DESCRIPTION

When "looping over hashes," we mean looping over hash keys or hash values. If
you forgot to call `keys` or `values` you will accidentally loop over both.

    foreach my $foo (%hash) {...}        # not ok
    action() for %hash;                  # not ok
    foreach my $foo ( keys %hash ) {...} # ok
    action() for values %hash;           # ok

An effort is made to detect expressions:

    action() for %hash ? keys %hash : ();                             # ok
    action() for %{ $hash{'stuff'} } ? keys %{ $hash{'stuff'} } : (); # ok

(Granted, the second example there doesn't make much sense, but I have found
a variation of it in real code.)

# CONFIGURATION

This policy is not configurable except for the standard options.
